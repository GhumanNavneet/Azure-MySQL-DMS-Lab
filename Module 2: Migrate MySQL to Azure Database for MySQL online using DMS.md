# Module 2: Migrate MySQL to Azure Database for MySQL online using DMS

You can use the Azure Database Migration Service to migrate the databases from an on-premises MySQL instance to Azure Database for MySQL with minimal downtime. In other words, migration can be achieved with minimum downtime to the application. In this tutorial, you migrate the Employees sample database from an on-premises instance of MySQL 5.7 to Azure Database for MySQL by using an online migration activity in the Azure Database Migration Service.
In this tutorial, you learn how to:
*   Create an Azure Database for MySQL server 
*	Migrate the sample schema using mysqldump utility.
*	Create an instance of the Azure Database Migration Service.
*	Create a migration project by using the Azure Database Migration Service.
*	Run the migration.
*	Monitor the migration.

## Get the connection information

To connect to your database server, you need the full server name and admin sign-in credentials. You might have noted those values earlier in the Quickstart article. If you didn't, you can easily find the server name and sign-in information from the server Overview page or the Properties page in the Azure portal.
To find these values, take the following steps:
1.	Open your server's Overview page. Make a note of the Server name and Server admin login name.
2.	Hover your cursor over each field, and the copy icon appears to the right of the text. Select the copy icon as needed to copy the values.

In this example, the server name is mydemoserver.mysql.database.azure.com, and the server admin sign-in is myadmin@mydemoserver.
Continue to the next section for a similar exercise. The next exercise connects to the same server by using another common tool, MySQL Workbench. Azure Cloud shell

## Connect to MySQL by using Cloud Shell

1. Launch Azure Cloud Shell via the terminal icon **(>_)** on the upper right of the Azure portal.

2. Azure Cloud Shell opens in your browser, where you can type bash shell commands.

3. At the Cloud Shell prompt, connect to your Azure Database for MySQL server by typing the mysql command line.To connect to an Azure Database for MySQL server with the mysql utility, use the following format:
```
mysql --host <fully qualified server name> --user <server admin login name>@<server name> -p
```
After it's connected, the mysql utility displays a mysql> prompt at which you can type commands.
<img src="images/mySQL_utilitybox.png"/>

4. To ensure the connection is functional, view the server status by typing status at the mysql> prompt.
```
status
```
5. Create a blank database at the mysql> prompt by typing the following command:
```
CREATE DATABASE employees;
```
The command might take a few moments to complete.

6. List the databases at the mysql> prompt by typing the following command:
```
SHOW DATABASES;
```
7. Type **\q**, and then select the Enter key to quit the mysql tool. You can close Azure Cloud Shell after you are done.

## Migrate the sample schema

To complete all the database objects like table schemas, indexes and stored procedures, we need to extract schema from the source database and apply to the database. To extract schema, you can use mysqldump with - - no-data parameter.

If you have foreign keys in your schema, the initial load and continuous sync of the migration will fail. Execute the following script in MySQL workbench to extract the drop foreign key script and add foreign key script.
```
SET group_concat_max_len = 8192;
    SELECT SchemaName, GROUP_CONCAT(DropQuery SEPARATOR ';\n') as DropQuery, GROUP_CONCAT(AddQuery SEPARATOR ';\n') as AddQuery
    FROM
    (SELECT 
    KCU.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA as SchemaName,    
    KCU.TABLE_NAME,
    KCU.COLUMN_NAME,
    CONCAT('ALTER TABLE ', KCU.TABLE_NAME, ' DROP FOREIGN KEY ', KCU.CONSTRAINT_NAME) AS DropQuery,
    CONCAT('ALTER TABLE ', KCU.TABLE_NAME, ' ADD CONSTRAINT ', KCU.CONSTRAINT_NAME, ' FOREIGN KEY (`', KCU.COLUMN_NAME, '`) REFERENCES `', KCU.REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME, '` (`', KCU.REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME, '`) ON UPDATE ',RC.UPDATE_RULE, ' ON DELETE ',RC.DELETE_RULE) AS AddQuery
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE KCU, information_schema.REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS RC
    WHERE
      KCU.CONSTRAINT_NAME = RC.CONSTRAINT_NAME
      AND KCU.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = RC.UNIQUE_CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA
  AND KCU.REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA = 'SchemaName') Queries
  GROUP BY SchemaName;
```  
  
Run the drop foreign key (which is the second column) in the query result to drop foreign key.we need to run the some more queries to drop the foreign key.
```
SELECT concat('ALTER TABLE ', TABLE_NAME, ' DROP FOREIGN KEY ', CONSTRAINT_NAME, ';') 
FROM information_schema.key_column_usage 
WHERE CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA = 'employees' 
AND referenced_table_name IS NOT NULL;
```

If you have trigger in the data (insert or update trigger), it will enforce data integrity in the target ahead of the replicated data from the source. The recommendation is to disable triggers in all the tables at the target during migration, and then enable the triggers after migration is done.

To disable triggers in target database, use the following command:
```
SELECT Concat('DROP TRIGGER ', Trigger_Name, ';') FROM  information_schema.TRIGGERS WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA = 'your_schema';
```

Assuming you have MySQL employees sample database in the on-premise system, the command to do schema migration using mysqldump is:
```
mysqldump -h [servername] -u [username] -p[password] --databases [db name] --no-data > [schema file path]
```
To import schema to Azure Database for MySQL target, run the following command:
```
mysql.exe -h [servername] -u [username] -p[password] [database]< [schema file path]
```

## Create a migration project
We have already dms instance in Azure portal, open it, and then create a new migration project.<br/>
1.	In the Azure portal, select All services, search for Azure Database Migration Service, and then select Azure Database Migration Services.Select + **New Migration Project**.<br/>
 <img src="images/08_new_migration_project.png"/><br/>
4.	On the New migration project screen, specify a name for the project, in the Source server type text box, select MySQL, in the Target server type text box, select AzureDatabaseForMySQL.<br/>
5. In the **Choose type of activity** section, select **Online data migration**.
``` 
Note
Alternately, you can chose Create project only to create the migration project now and execute the migration later.
```
6.	Select Save, note the requirements to successfully use DMS to migrate data, and then select Create and run activity.<br/>
<img src="images/09_create_project.png"/>

## Specify source details
1.	On the Add Source Details screen, specify the connection details for the source MySQL instance.<br/>
 <img src="images/dms9.jpg"/><br/>
 
## Specify target details
1.	Select Save, and then on the Target details screen, specify the connection details for the target Azure Database for MySQL server, which is the pre-provisioned instance of Azure Database for MySQL to which the Employees schema was deployed by using mysqldump.<br/>
 <img src="images/dms10.jpg"/><br/>
2.	Select Save, and then on the Map to target databases screen, map the source and the target database for migration.<br/>
If the target database contains the same database name as the source database, the Azure Database Migration Service selects the target database by default.<br/>
 <img src="images/dms11.jpg"/><br/>
3.	Select Save, on the Migration summary screen, in the Activity name text box, specify a name for the migration activity, and then review the summary to ensure that the source and target details match what you previously specified.<br/>
 <img src="images/dms12.jpg"/><br/>
Run the migration
*	Select Run migration.
The migration activity window appears, and the Status of the activity is initializing.

## Monitor the migration
1.	On the migration activity screen, select Refresh to update the display until the Status of the migration shows as Complete.<br/>
 <img src="images/dms13.jpg"/><br/>
2.	Under Database Name, select specific database to get to the migration status for Full data load and Incremental data sync operations.
Full data load will show the initial load migration status while Incremental data sync will show change data capture (CDC) status.
 
## Perform migration cutover
After the initial Full load is completed, the databases are marked Ready to cutover.
1.	When you're ready to complete the database migration, select Start Cutover.
 <img src="images/dms14.jpg"/><br/>
2.	Make sure to stop all the incoming transactions to the source database; wait until the Pending changes counter shows 0.
3.	Select Confirm, and the select Apply.
4.	When the database migration status shows Completed, connect your applications to the new target Azure SQL Database.
